\f1\b0\fs24 \cf0 In this project, we compared the performance of MongoDB, a NoSQL database, with MySQL, a traditional SQL database, focusing on query speed, scalability, and data storage efficiency. During the performance tests, MongoDB demonstrated significantly faster insertion times for bulk data due to its schema-less architecture. This characteristic allows for quick data entry without the overhead of strict data structures. However, MongoDB exhibited slower query times, particularly for complex queries involving joins, which are common in relational data operations.\
In contrast, MySQL had a longer insertion time as it enforced a defined schema, which necessitated validation of data types and relationships. Nonetheless, its query performance excelled when dealing with structured data and relationships, returning results more efficiently than MongoDB. Overall, the results indicate that MongoDB is better suited for handling large volumes of unstructured data where rapid insertions are critical, while MySQL remains the preferred choice for structured datasets that require complex queries.\
